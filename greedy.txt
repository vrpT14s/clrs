Proof of greedinesss of the fractional knapsack problem:
Thief has to take oil with weight w_i and v_i each, can take any fraction. Weight must not exceed W and we must find the optimum choice. As expected we choose in decreasing order of "value for money", i.e. value/weight density. The proof that there always exists an optimum choice where the most dense object has been placed as much as it can, i.e the greedy choice property or the greediness of the algorithm etc.(?), is like so: Assume none of the optimum choices have the most dense object being fully taken (forgetting the case where the capacity of the thief is less than the amount of oil there is, that is similarly easy to prove), we then take one of these and call the amount of most dense oil taken out v_i, by assumption v_i < w_i. Then we will create another choice where the second densest oil gets removed in w_i - v_i amounts, replacing this with the densest. The increase in value is (w_i - v_i)(d_i - d_j) where the second densest is d_j. Clearly this is positive and greater than zero. Thus we have created a solution strictly greater than the optimum solution, so contradiction.
